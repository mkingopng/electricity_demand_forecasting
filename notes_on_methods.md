## Forecasting Methods

**Vintage smoothing methods, recursive, statsmodels**
- single exponential smoothing
- double exponential smoothing (Holt)
- triple exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters)

**State space models**
- Kalman filter

**Statistical methods**
- regression
- General additive models
- ARIMA / SARIMA: auto regressive models

**ML Methods**
- Prophet (Facebook): 
- GBDT (XGBoost or LightGBM)

**Deep methods:** 
- LSTM
- TS Transformer
- KATS
- Neural Prophet

**Validation Methods:**
- normal CV doesn't work for time series for obvious reasons
- hold out / split needs to be based on time
- rolling holdout set / sliding window
- Time Series KFold


- There is a generic header that we need to replace. I've tried to delete it 
  but it doesn't seem to work as expected.
- Table of contents looks a bit wonky. I've tried to fix it but i seem to 
  make it worse
- Referencing: William already mentioned this regarding APA v7. I'm ok with 
  that.
- My changes: i shouldn't accept my own changes. William or Noel can you 
  assist please? There are not many
- are we keeping the data section in methods or combining it with data 
  collection and preprocessing?
- Consistent fonts
- Individual reflections

# To do for report
- Results graphs comparing the different models
- table with summary of results for each model
- other opportunities for improvements
