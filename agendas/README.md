# 2024-03-27 questions (mk):
- think I've dealt with time stamp issues and missing values. Pls confirm?
- I'm struggling to find HH temperature data to augment the project data we 
  have. can we know where it came from?
- We're looking at the additional variables we can collect and add to the 
  model to improve it.
- questions around HH samples and 5 min samples for demand

- get all the variables into a single df. 
- plot month wise and year wise, day wise etc
- 

- I'm having trouble getting the basic time series decomposition to work. I'm 
  not getting errors but it just doesn't look right
- How to determine the current forecast accuracy?
- Looking at a simple heatmap, it doesn't look like temperature is a very 
  powerful factor. But it's universally agreed to be the most powerful 
  factor. I don't really understand the dissonance
- what are lagged features and how do we create them?
- ForecastDemand 'DATETIME': appears to have 72 readings per 30 minute interval,
   we need confirmation that this is correct, we would need to group on DATETIME and 
   take the average of FORECASTDEMAND column.
